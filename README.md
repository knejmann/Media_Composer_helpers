# Media_Composer_helpers

These are some tools I've created to process metadata from Avid Media Composer timelines.

## Timeline Clip Notes Sum

This tool reads a list of Timeline Clip Notes exported from Media Composer. It lists them in a human-readable format and also sums up the duration of clips with the same clip name.
This can be used for music reporting.

Usage: Place the two files in the same directory and launch the .html file in a browser.
